    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>

    <p>Every year in the United States, millions of Americans are negatively affected by pest-related interactions, and most lack the awareness and experience to prevent or effectively mitigate their impact.</p>

    </br>
    </br>
    
    <h3>Problem Characteristics</h3>
    
    <!-- TODO: Link the citations back to references page -->
    <ul>

      <li><h4>Pests pose physical danger to humans and pets</h4></li>

      <p>Like most pests, dangerous predators and scavengers like wolves, bears and coyotes will often cross paths with humans and their pets in search of food.  Wolves have become an increasing and ever-present threat to farmers and their cattle in the Midwest[12] while bears have gained more notoriety for breaking into homes, cars, and dumpsters as their numbers increase[11].  The coyote populations have also been on the rise -- especially in urban areas and pose a significant threat to pets of unwary owners[10].</p>
      
      <li><h4>Pests are vectors for disease</h4></li>
      
      <p>Many common pests are known to harbor debilitating and potentially fatal diseases.  Pests like ticks and mosquitoes are carriers of ailments like lyme disease, west nile virus, and malaria[6].  Even worse, raccoons and skunks are common carriers of the fatal disease rabies[7], and cases of bubonic plague can be spread by fleas and have been reported as recently as 2019[4][5].</p>
      
      <li><h4>Pest populations are rising</h4></li>
           
      <p>Most direct and indirect evidence suggests the prevalence of pests will only increase in the coming years.  Warmer winters result in greater pest populations in the spring and summer[2].  If the climate continues warming in the coming years as many scientists predict[3], pest populations will also continue to grow.  In the span of 11 years, the pest control industry has increased in value by $5.2 billion from $11.7 to $16.9 billion; by the end of 2022, it is projected to reach $17.4 billion[1].  The growth in the industry is a strong indicator there is (and will be) similar growth among pest populations as well.</p>
      
      <li><h4>Pests Inflict heavy financial costs</h4></li>
      
      <p>Damage to the production of goods and related services by invasive insect species in the United States is estimated to be $30.2 billion dollars per year[13].  And, in addition to that, insects like termites infest over 600,000 homes each year which results in $5 billion dollars of property damage[8].  Treatments for pest related diseases also carry a heavy cost burden.  According to one study conducted by John Hopkins University, treatments for lyme disease alone cost an annual estimated $1.3 billion[9].</p>
